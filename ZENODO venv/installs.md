These are the install instructions from the workshop's github: https://github.com/uc-love-data-week/intermediate-apis/blob/main/setup.md

Install Python

In this lesson, we will be using Python 3 in Jupyter Notebook with the following libraries: flatten_json, pandas, requests Although one can install a plain-vanilla Python and all required libraries by hand, we recommend installing Anaconda, a Python distribution that comes with everything we need for the lesson. Detailed installation instructions for various operating systems can be found on The Carpentries template website for workshops and in Anaconda documentation.

If you don't have Jupyter or another Python environment set up, you can use Google Colab to write your code. Another option is to use Binder -- this will spin up a notebook with the contents of this repo.

Install Libraries

On macOS and Linux, you can install the packages on the command line using the following commands

pip install flatten_json

pip install pandas

pip install requests

On Windows, it's often easier to install using the Anaconda interface.

Open Anaconda
Click on Environments
Search if your package you want to is already installed
If not, search for the package under not installed, then select the package and click "apply" to install
